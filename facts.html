						<li>Rabbits and hares are &#147lagomorphs&#148, an order that also includes the pika, a small burrowing mammal that looks like a large mouse and lives in colder climates.</li>
						<li>Lagomorphs were originally classified as rodents, but in 1912 the distinction was made between them and rodents.</li>
						<li>Rabbits are meticulously clean animals and are easy to house break and train.  Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap, and do simple tricks.</li>
						<li>Happy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a &#147binky&#148: they jump up in the air and twist and spin around!</li>
						<li>A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck.  A group of rabbits is called a herd.</li>
						<li>Can you guess what other domestic animal is similar to rabbits?  A horse!  They have similar eyes, teeth, and ears (those belonging to many prey animals), as well as a similar diet and behavior.  Clearly, their size is much different&#133</li>
						<li>A rabbit symbol is often used to show that a product was not tested on animals.  This is because rabbits have traditionally been used in product safety testing.</li>
						<li>Bunnies cannot vomit, so it is super important to feed them only healthy, fresh, appropriate food.</li>
